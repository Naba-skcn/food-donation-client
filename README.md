## Project Overview

- Nutri Harvest is a food donation website where users can add foods for donation, donate foods, request food by viewing their details, see available foods, update and delete their added foods, and view their requested foods.

## Major Features

- **Available Foods**: Users can view only foods marked as "available". If a food's status is "requested", it will not appear in the available foods section.
- **View details**: Users can view food details and request them. After clicking the request button, the food's status will change to "requested", and the user can see their requested foods on the food request page with vital information.
- **Virtual Food Drive**: Users can donate food virtually to help achieve meal goals.
